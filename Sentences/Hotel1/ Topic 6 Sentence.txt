they will still charge you for the view and not even consider a courtesy upgrade.

Assured by front desk room would be availlable by 3 pm which is the check in time.

Might be a good place for tourists, but try another place if you are in Amsterdam on business.

If you want something a bit different I am sure you will find a Bed and Breakfast of better quality at a fraction of the price.

Also, the hotel would be advised to forget the waffles, chocolate and water freebies and provide tea and coffee making facilities.

Rooms are decent I will give them credit for that
