Might be a good place for tourists, but try another place if you are in Amsterdam on business.

If you want something a bit different I am sure you will find a Bed and Breakfast of better quality at a fraction of the price.

If you catch them right your in a 4 star hotel - if not -your going to get pot luck on some services.

Don't get fool by book reviews and movies, this hotel is not a five star luxury experience,

When you request a canal view room, be aware that even if it is available

they will still charge you for the view and not even consider a courtesy upgrade.

If you were getting this hotel 'free' with points it would be a bargin espiecally if you could get a canal view room -

Assured by front desk room would be availlable by 3 pm which is the check in time.
