You have to jig and jog (and jig and jog) to get to the only bar/restaurant (both of which are nice/just okay).

And heaven help if you need to go to the bathroom while at the bar/restaurant (over the river and through the woods, to grandmother's house we go...).

Trust me save your money, this hotel it's a total joke!

Might be a good place for tourists, but try another place if you are in Amsterdam on business.

you must take a long and gloomy corridor, with no decoration, which looks like you are in a basic motel.

and bars nearby - would recommend the Koh i Noor indian around the corner - book in advance as it is small and well used by locals.

equally you could be let down by poorly trained staff and find yourself looking at a white wall in your tiny room.

however if booking again I would state a room on a high floor as the canal can be noisy at weekends with the locals taking to their boats.

you want to be on prinzen/heren/kaiserstraat simply bcs its a true pictoresque neighborhood

and sunny - worth staying here for location alone - only the Dylan would compare if you want quiet and upmarket residential area.

I would recommend the Pulitzer to others and would stay there again myself.

If you want something a bit different I am sure you will find a Bed and Breakfast of better quality at a fraction of the price.
