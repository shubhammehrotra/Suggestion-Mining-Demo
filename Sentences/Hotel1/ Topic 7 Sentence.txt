and sunny - worth staying here for location alone - only the Dylan would compare if you want quiet and upmarket residential area.

And heaven help if you need to go to the bathroom while at the bar/restaurant (over the river and through the woods, to grandmother's house we go...).

Room is on the small side (smaller than most Sheraton standard rooms),

concierge desk has plenty of umbrellas at their desk if you need to borrow one; lighting inside the rooms seemed a bit sparse if you like it bright;

Most luxury hotels will avoid booking rooms around this sort of renovation - or at the very least warn the guests - but not the Pulitzer.

Bad news is that the Dutch (and/or European) staff on reception

equally you could be let down by poorly trained staff and find yourself looking at a white wall in your tiny room.

and staff quality I would advise you to go to one of the better know chain hotels, at least you know what to expect.

If you catch them right your in a 4 star hotel - if not -your going to get pot luck on some services.

however you might have trouble if you order room service...

but if you are coming here for the service that you expect for wha they claim to be...

I would recommend saying at a Hostel they would be much more courtesy that the service I received here.
